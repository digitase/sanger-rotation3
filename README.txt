Using Homoplasy to Study Recent Selection in Staphylococcus aureus

    There is a separate directory for each ST/lineage that we discussed. Within
    each directory you will find the reference strain used for mapping to generate
    the alignment (e.g. For ST22: CC22_EMRSA15.fasta), the whole genome alignment
    (e.g. S.aureus_ST22_BSAC_Pfizer.aln), core genome alignment (MGE blocks masked,
    e.g. S.aureus_ST22_BSAC_Pfizer_no_mge.aln) and the core genome snp alignment
    (e.g. S.aureus_ST22_BSAC_Pfizer_no_mge_snp.aln). Iâ€™ve generated a tree for each
    ST (except ST8, still running) for you to use (RAxML_bestTree*). For each
    lineage the reference strain should be included in the alignment and tree
    files, this is needed if you want to know the context of a SNP position (e.g.
    Intergenic, synonymous, non-synonymous).
